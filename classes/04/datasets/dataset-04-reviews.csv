2017-07-04,R29ISC3WOB5X8E,Mason selby,Highly recommend,"I have bought silicon rings before and they are fragile. They always broke into two parts after only one or two weeks. I was suspicious of this one set. But after two weeks, it still holds on my finger. Really impressed. I will continute to observe their performance. I am satisfied so far and willing to recommend to my friends.",5.0

2017-06-30,R241VVTXQX1WM6,Steven Hodgkins,I have yet to find a better deal that lasts through abuse,"For the money, I have yet to find a better deal that lasts through abuse.  I do industrial welding, for 10 hours a day.  After a month, they are no worse for the wear.  And, since I had a foot long length of angle iron fall on my finger from three feet, I will stick with these because you can cut them off with a pair of scissors.",5.0
2017-06-26,R25X9FCD2W2F,Alicia Corona,Very satisfied. Highly recommended,"I bought these rings for my husband. When I got these, I thought they would be useful when he has to do car maintenance or anything else where a traditional metal band would be uncomfortable. When he opened them, he was super excited. Especially because there were 4 different colors.  He was impressed with how comfortable the ring was.",5.0

2017-06-22,R3703RZSG3WMA7,H ome,perfect fit!,"Because of my work, I usually do not take my ring. I decided to try a silicone wedding band. I chose the Aven it band because they offered four colors, specifically the Navy Blue, and there are no logos to other marking on the outside of the band. Sizing was spot on, a little snug at first, but it quickly becomes a perfect fit.",5.0
